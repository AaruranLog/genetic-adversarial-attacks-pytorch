# Genetic Adversarial Attacks in PyTorch

This repository implements of a project submitted to Professor Jeff Orchard, at the University of Waterloo. The repository explores the development of adversarial examples using genetic algorithms possessing black-box access to a deep neural network.

The project is based on the work of [this repository](https://github.com/nesl/adversarial_genattack) but contains several novelties.
